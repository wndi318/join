            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a>
                leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>
                Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a>:
            </p>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>1.</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you log in to <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a>, you'll find a default board.
                        This board represents your project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>2.</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                    <p>
                        In <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                        assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>3.</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
                        details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>4.</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3> Moving Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                        dropping the card from one list to another.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>5.</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                        card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                        this action is irreversible.

                        Remember that using <a href="#" class="highlight-text">Join</a> effectively requires consistent
                        updates from you and your team to
                        ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
